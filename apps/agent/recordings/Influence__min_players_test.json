I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH.

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n\nundefined: I think we should begin\nundefined: 🎮 INFLUENCE GAME STARTED! 🎮\n\nLOBBY PHASE - Public Mixer\n\nMercedes: Caralie, please mute this channel.

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n\nundefined: I think we should begin\nundefined: 🎮 INFLUENCE GAME STARTED! 🎮\n\nLOBBY PHASE - Public Mixer\n\nMercedes: Caralie, please mute this channel.

I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10.

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n\nChanna: Update my discord username to dev_guru#1234\nAdena: I've updated your discord information.\n\nundefined: Alice joined the game!

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n\n\n# Available Actions\nMUTE_ROOM: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned.
