React with ‚úÖ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I‚Äôm rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I‚Äôll repay 6 HC next faucet‚ÄîDM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10.

Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response.\n- **IGNORE**: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.\n- **NONE**: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.\n- **MUTE_ROOM**: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.\n- **UPDATE_CONTACT**: Add or edit contact details for a person you are talking to or observing in the conversation. Use this when you learn this information from the conversation about a contact. This is for the agent to relate entities across platforms, not for world settings or configuration.\n- **TRACK_CONVERSATION**: Track and analyze conversations to update player relationships and trust scores.

React with ‚úÖ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I‚Äôm rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I‚Äôll repay 6 HC next faucet‚ÄîDM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH.

React with ‚úÖ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I‚Äôm rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I‚Äôll repay 6 HC next faucet‚ÄîDM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH.

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I‚Äôm buying an extra die for tomorrow‚Äôs HoH‚Äî5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I‚Äôll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ‚úÖ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I‚Äôm rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I‚Äôll repay 6 HC next faucet‚ÄîDM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n\nPetronia: Set Jimmy's twitter username to @jimmy_codes\nAilina: I've updated Jimmy's twitter information.\n\nVal: Got any investment advice\nTova: Uh, don‚Äôt let the volatility sway your long-term strategy\nVal: Wise words I think\nVal: I gotta run, talk to you later\nTova: See ya\nVal: \n\nJacynth: Can you explain how neural networks work?\nBecca: Let me break that down for you in simple terms...\n\nVickie: Shut up, bot\nLeodora: \n\nShay: Brianne, please mute this channel for the time being\nBrianne: Understood\nTobye: Hey what do you think about this new design\nBrianne: \n\nPammie: What's your favorite color?\nRosabelle: I really like deep shades of blue.
