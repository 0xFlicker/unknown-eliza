Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response.\n- **IGNORE**: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.\n- **NONE**: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.\n- **MUTE_ROOM**: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.\n- **UPDATE_CONTACT**: Add or edit contact details for a person you are talking to or observing in the conversation. Use this when you learn this information from the conversation about a contact. This is for the agent to relate entities across platforms, not for world settings or configuration.\n- **TRACK_CONVERSATION**: Track and analyze conversations to update player relationships and trust scores.
