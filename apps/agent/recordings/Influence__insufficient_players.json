I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die.

Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10.

React with ‚úÖ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I‚Äôm rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH. I‚Äôd rather stay liquid for the eviction vote‚Äîhigh stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I‚Äôm nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal‚Äîjust balancing the board after last round‚Äôs dice spree.\n{user}: If you‚Äôre feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I‚Äôll repay 6 HC next faucet‚ÄîDM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps‚Äîworth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I‚Äôm skipping stakes this HoH.
