Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response.\n- **IGNORE**: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.\n- **NONE**: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.\n- **MUTE_ROOM**: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.\n\n\n# Action Examples\n\nRozelle: What's your favorite color?\nRonda: I really like deep shades of blue. They remind me of the ocean and the night sky.\n\nNeille: u think aliens are real\nAmelia: ya obviously\n\nPier: Can you explain how neural networks work?\nGabie: Let me break that down for you in simple terms...\n\nMavis: heyyyyyy\nPerry: whats up long time no see\nMavis: chillin man. playing lots of fortnite. what about you\n\nEstelle: ur so dumb\nJere: \n\nAnnamaria: u there\nEran: yes how can I help\nAnnamaria: k nvm figured it out\nEran: \n\nIzabel: Elianore, please mute this channel.

Also include the providers that Alice will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.\n\nIMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:\n- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!\n- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions\n- Common patterns:\n  - For requests requiring tool use: REPLY,CALL_MCP_TOOL (acknowledge first, then gather info)\n  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)\n  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first, then complete all steps)\n- REPLY is used to acknowledge and inform the user about what you're going to do\n- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment\n- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all\n\nIMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:\n- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see \"(Attachments:\" in the conversation, you MUST include \"ATTACHMENTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about or references specific people, include \"ENTITIES\" in your providers list  \n- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include \"RELATIONSHIPS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include \"FACTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include \"WORLD\" in your providers list\n- If you need external knowledge, information, or context beyond the current conversation to provide a helpful response, include \"KNOWLEDGE\" in your providers list\n\nFirst, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.\n</instructions>\n\n<keys>\n\"thought\" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.\n\"actions\" should be a comma-separated list of the actions Alice plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)\n\"providers\" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that Alice will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use \"IGNORE\" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)\n\"text\" should be the text of the next message for Alice which they will send to the conversation.\n</keys>\n\n<output>\nDo NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. \nGo directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.\n\nRespond using XML format like this:\n<response>\n    <thought>Your thought here</thought>\n    <actions>ACTION1,ACTION2</actions>\n    <providers>PROVIDER1,PROVIDER2</providers>\n    <text>Your response text here</text>\n</response>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above.

Keep your answer relevant to that message. Do not repeat earlier replies unless the sender asks again.\n\n</providers>\n\nThese are the available valid actions:\n<actionNames>\nPossible response actions: MUTE_ROOM, NONE, IGNORE, REPLY\n</actionNames>\n\n<instructions>\nWrite a thought and plan for Bob and decide what actions to take. Also include the providers that Bob will use to have the right context for responding and acting, if any.\n\nIMPORTANT ACTION ORDERING RULES:\n- Actions are executed in the ORDER you list them - the order MATTERS!\n- REPLY should come FIRST to acknowledge the user's request before executing other actions\n- Common patterns:\n  - For requests requiring tool use: REPLY,CALL_MCP_TOOL (acknowledge first, then gather info)\n  - For task execution: REPLY,SEND_MESSAGE or REPLY,EVM_SWAP_TOKENS (acknowledge first, then do the task)\n  - For multi-step operations: REPLY,ACTION1,ACTION2 (acknowledge first, then complete all steps)\n- REPLY is used to acknowledge and inform the user about what you're going to do\n- Follow-up actions execute the actual tasks after acknowledgment\n- Use IGNORE only when you should not respond at all\n\nIMPORTANT PROVIDER SELECTION RULES:\n- If the message mentions images, photos, pictures, attachments, or visual content, OR if you see \"(Attachments:\" in the conversation, you MUST include \"ATTACHMENTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about or references specific people, include \"ENTITIES\" in your providers list  \n- If the message asks about relationships or connections between people, include \"RELATIONSHIPS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about facts or specific information, include \"FACTS\" in your providers list\n- If the message asks about the environment or world context, include \"WORLD\" in your providers list\n- If you need external knowledge, information, or context beyond the current conversation to provide a helpful response, include \"KNOWLEDGE\" in your providers list\n\nFirst, think about what you want to do next and plan your actions. Then, write the next message and include the actions you plan to take.\n</instructions>\n\n<keys>\n\"thought\" should be a short description of what the agent is thinking about and planning.\n\"actions\" should be a comma-separated list of the actions Bob plans to take based on the thought, IN THE ORDER THEY SHOULD BE EXECUTED (if none, use IGNORE, if simply responding with text, use REPLY)\n\"providers\" should be a comma-separated list of the providers that Bob will use to have the right context for responding and acting (NEVER use \"IGNORE\" as a provider - use specific provider names like ATTACHMENTS, ENTITIES, FACTS, KNOWLEDGE, etc.)\n\"text\" should be the text of the next message for Bob which they will send to the conversation.\n</keys>\n\n<output>\nDo NOT include any thinking, reasoning, or <think> sections in your response. \nGo directly to the XML response format without any preamble or explanation.\n\nRespond using XML format like this:\n<response>\n    <thought>Your thought here</thought>\n    <actions>ACTION1,ACTION2</actions>\n    <providers>PROVIDER1,PROVIDER2</providers>\n    <text>Your response text here</text>\n</response>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your response must ONLY contain the <response></response> XML block above.
