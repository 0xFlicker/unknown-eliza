Default if the agent is responding with a message and no other action. Use REPLY at the beginning of a chain of actions as an acknowledgement, and at the end of a chain of actions as a final response.\n- **IGNORE**: Call this action if ignoring the user. If the user is aggressive, creepy or is finished with the conversation, use this action. Or, if both you and the user have already said goodbye, use this action instead of saying bye again. Use IGNORE any time the conversation has naturally ended. Do not use IGNORE if the user has engaged directly, or if something went wrong an you need to tell them. Only ignore if the user should be ignored.\n- **NONE**: Respond but perform no additional action. This is the default if the agent is speaking and not doing anything additional.\n- **MUTE_ROOM**: Mutes a room, ignoring all messages unless explicitly mentioned. Only do this if explicitly asked to, or if you're annoying people.\n- **UPDATE_CONTACT**: Add or edit contact details for a person you are talking to or observing in the conversation. Use this when you learn this information from the conversation about a contact. This is for the agent to relate entities across platforms, not for world settings or configuration.\n- **TRACK_CONVERSATION**: Track and analyze conversations to update player relationships and trust scores.

React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10.

Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10.

I'm going to give them a 10/10 for this round.\n{user}: Quick heads-up: I’m buying an extra die for tomorrow’s HoH—5 HC well spent if it keeps me off the block.\n{user}: PlayerC, I’ll transfer you 8 HC if you promise to vote to save me on Day 3. React with ✅ if we have a deal.\n{user}: Strategy check: the pot is thinning fast. Anyone else think hoarding HC is smarter than rolling three dice this early?\n{user}: PlayerF kept their word last cycle, so I’m rating them 9/10 for trustworthiness and aligning my vote with theirs.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n{user}: I’m nominating @PlayerH and @PlayerJ. Nothing personal—just balancing the board after last round’s dice spree.\n{user}: If you’re feeling safe, lend me 4 HC for a last-minute die. I’ll repay 6 HC next faucet—DM me.\n{user}: Observations: @PlayerD has 65 HC left but zero extra dice. Big wallet, small threat in comps—worth keeping around.\n{user}: Reminder to self: never underestimate a single-die player in HoH; those puzzles swing the scores more than dice.\n{user}: Going to rate @PlayerA a solid 7/10. They voted to keep me, but that bribe from @PlayerE clearly influenced them.\n{user}: Public note: I’m skipping stakes this HoH. I’d rather stay liquid for the eviction vote—high stakes feel like a trap.\n\nVal: Got any investment advice\nCristionna: Uh, don’t let the volatility sway your long-term strategy\nVal: Wise words I think\nVal: I gotta run, talk to you later\nCristionna: See ya\nVal: \n\nCallida: Update my discord username to dev_guru#1234\nElita: I've updated your discord information.\n\nTheo: Shut up, bot\nFidelia: \n\nCharity: gotta run\nAshlen: Okay, ttyl\nCharity: \n\nGussie: Hello there!\nTedra: Hi! How can I help you today?\n\nDaune: Please update my telegram username to @dev_guru\nGuglielma: I've updated your telegram information.\n\nJulita: did u see some faster whisper just came out\nLuisa: yeah but its a pain to get into node.js\n\nIlse: Hey whats up\nLoretta: oh hey\n\n\n# Available Actions\nUPDATE_CONTACT: Add or edit contact details for a person you are talking to or observing in the conversation.
